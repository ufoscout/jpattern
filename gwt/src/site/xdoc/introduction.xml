		<section name="JPATTERN-GWT: everything you need to implement the MVP architecture with GWT and restful">
		<p>
			This project manage most of the complexity in the development of a MVP architecture when you want
			to use a pure restful server side.
			<br/>GWT is used only a compile time to generate the client javascript. No dependency on GWT libraries are present
			at runtime.
			<br/><br/>
			The framework lives around the concept of "event". Every user action triggers a specific event.
